## Summary

Implement function-resolution feature to handle 5 failing test cases in reference tests.

## Problem

Reference test results show 5 cases fail with function-resolution diagnostic. The compiler cannot handle these syntax/semantics, preventing compilation of code in this category.

## Desired final state

function-resolution feature is correctly implemented according to JavaScript/TypeScript specifications. Related diagnostics are only emitted for genuinely unsupported cases.

## Scope

In scope:

- [ ] Add required syntax to lexer/parser
- [ ] Implement semantics for function-resolution feature
- [ ] Add fixtures for function-resolution feature behavior
- [ ] Update diagnostics appropriately

Out of scope:

- [ ] Related features (separate issues)

## Affected paths

Expected:

- `crates/frontend/src/`
- `crates/cli/src/`
- `fixtures/`

Do not touch:

- `crates/runtime-abi/`
- `crates/backend-wasm/`

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] function-resolution feature passes for basic cases
- [ ] Related diagnostics reduced in reference tests
- [ ] Regression test added for function-resolution feature
- [ ] Docs updated if semantics change

## Validation

Required commands:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo nextest run
```

Impacted commands:

```sh
scripts/run/reference-coverage.sh test262 --limit 10
```
